# Platino RECD Tracker — Handover

## 1. What it is
A role‑based **Project & Service Tracker** for Platino, an RECD (Retrofit Emission Control Device) manufacturing + installation business. It tracks an order from sale through on‑site installation and commissioning (the **SITC** process: Supply → Installation → Testing → Commissioning), handles customer complaints, and gives each role a tailored view. Built to ship **Phase 1** now while keeping the full long‑term vision **future‑ready**.

## 2. Stack & layout
Turborepo monorepo, **npm workspaces**, TypeScript end‑to‑end. Working dir: `D:\Projects\Claude code`.

| Package | What | Key tech |
|---|---|---|
| `apps/api` | Backend REST API | Express **5**, Prisma, JWT auth |
| `apps/admin-web` | Staff + customer web console | Next.js **14** (App Router), Tailwind |
| `apps/mobile` | Field/customer mobile app | Expo / React Native (**not runtime‑tested**) |
| `packages/shared` | Cross‑app contracts | Zod schemas, constants, DTO types |

**Database:** Supabase Postgres (region `ap-northeast-1`), reached via **poolers** (direct connection needs IPv6) — transaction pooler `:6543?pgbouncer=true` for queries, session pooler `:5432` for migrations. Migration applied + seeded. Creds live only in gitignored `apps/api/.env`.

## 3. Core architecture principle — "data, not code"
Anything that might grow a new value later — **stages, roles, permissions, statuses, photo checkpoints, structure types** — is a **row in a table**, never a hardcoded enum. Adding a new stage/role/status later is a DB insert, not a code change. The only real enum is the structural `SitcPhase`. This is the literal mechanism behind "keep everything future‑ready."

Same pattern for **notifications** (one `NotificationService.send()` with real In‑App/Email providers + stubbed SMS/WhatsApp/Telegram behind the same interface) and the **structure‑diagram generator** (Phase‑2 stub behind an interface).

## 4. Roles & access model (central to the app)
**Super Admin ≠ Management** — this was a deliberate split for commercialization:
- **Super Admin** — the *only* role with `manage_settings`. Owns the white‑label/branding (logo, theme) for when the app is sold to other manufacturers. Full access otherwise.
- **Management** (Owner/Proprietor/CEO/CTO) — everything **except** Settings.
- **Sales** — orders. **Operations/PM** — site status + pending actions. **Erection/Commissioning Engineers** — update site status + act on complaints *assigned to them*. **Service Team** — triage/assign/resolve complaints. **Finance** — placeholder (no modules yet). **Customer** — own order/site only, raise complaints, resolve their own approvals.
- **`manage_vendors`** (Super Admin + Management) gates vendor approval and site→vendor assignment. **Erection engineers now belong to an external vendor** (`User.vendorId`) and see only their own vendor's sites — see §11.

The web UI gates every menu item **and** route by permission; the API enforces it independently.

## 5. What this work delivered (the hardening pass)
The build had the permission system + read‑only screens but **no action UIs**, so several roles couldn't do their job. This pass fixed that and closed an audit's worth of gaps. Committed as **`3974b32`** on `master`.

- **Complaints:** engineers act on **assigned tickets only** (new `act_assigned_complaints` permission; API 403s otherwise); Service Team assigns via a "Manage" modal.
- **Site updates:** status‑update form, checkpoint photo upload, exhaust‑hookup confirm — on the site detail page, gated by `change_site_status`.
- **Orders:** "New order" form with inline new‑customer creation (creates the customer + a contact whose **phone is their Order‑ID login credential**); `GET /orders` now permission‑gated.
- **Customer OTP** delivered over the **email channel** (dev mode echoes the code for testing; production never returns it).
- **Identity fix** (the "everyone shows as Zarina" bug): real `AuthProvider` + `GET /auth/me`; Finance (no perms) gets a clean **"No modules enabled yet"** screen instead of a blank page.
- **Security/robustness:** `authenticate` rejects deactivated users and reloads permissions per request; users are **deactivate/activate** (not hard‑deleted) with a last‑super‑admin guard; notifications are best‑effort; client handles 401; customer portal can resolve the exhaust‑hookup approval.

## 6. Verified working (live browser + API)
Erection engineer posted a status update → site advanced and the **customer portal reflected it**; customer logged in via Order ID + **email OTP** and raised a complaint; Service Team assigned it; engineer saw **only** that ticket, updated it (200), was **blocked (403)** from others; Super Admin saw Settings, Management didn't; Finance got the no‑modules screen. Both apps `tsc --noEmit` clean.

## 7. How to run + test
Servers are **live now** (`http://localhost:6001`). To run yourself from `D:\Projects\Claude code`:
```powershell
npx turbo run dev --filter=@recd/api --filter=@recd/admin-web
```
Staff logins: `superadmin@ / owner@ / sales@ / ops@ / erection@ / commissioning@ / service@ / finance@platino.example`, all password **`changeme123`**. Customer (Track My Order): `ORD-2026-0001` + `+919900011122` (OTP shows on‑screen + in the API terminal).

## 8. Before production / known gaps
- **Rotate secrets:** all seed passwords are `changeme123`, the Supabase DB password has been exposed in chat, and `JWT_SECRET` is a placeholder.
- **Email is a console stub** — `EMAIL_PROVIDER_API_KEY` empty; OTP/notifications log to the server console. Wire a real provider (Resend/SES/SendGrid) — no caller changes needed.
- **SMS/WhatsApp/Telegram** are deferred stubs.
- **Photo upload** stores base64 data‑URLs (works; no S3 yet).
- **Mobile app** not runtime‑tested — first run is `npx expo start` on a device.
- **Structure‑diagram generator** is schema‑only (Phase 2).
- Minor: `mustChangePassword` isn't server‑enforced on mutating routes (client‑guarded); `owner_admin` is an orphan role; New‑Order modal / photo upload / full exhaust‑mismatch loop are built + typecheck‑clean but not each click‑tested.

## 9. Vercel deployment
Two separate Vercel projects: **admin-web** (root directory `apps/admin-web`, Next.js) and **api** (root directory `apps/api`, Node). Both need "Include files outside the Root Directory in the Build Step" enabled since this is an npm-workspaces monorepo.

- **admin-web → api connection:** the browser calls `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (see `apps/admin-web/src/lib/apiClient.ts`), which is baked in at **build time**. Must be set as an env var on the admin-web Vercel project pointing at the deployed api project's URL — changing it requires a redeploy, not just a save.
- **api build pipeline:** `apps/api/vercel.json` uses `buildCommand: "npm run build"` (runs `prisma generate && tsc`) plus a plain‑JS `apps/api/api/index.js` that `require()`s the precompiled `dist/index.js`. **Do not** reintroduce a legacy `"builds"` array in that vercel.json — it silently makes Vercel ignore the dashboard Build/Install Command entirely, so `prisma generate` never runs, the deployed function has no real Prisma client, and every DB call crashes (`FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED`) while the build log fills with `TS7006`/`TS2694` implicit-`any` errors (Prisma-derived types collapsing without a generated client).
- **`packages/shared` must compile to CommonJS** (`packages/shared/tsconfig.json` overrides `module`/`moduleResolution`) — it's `require()`'d from `apps/api`'s CommonJS output, and plain Node (unlike bundler-based tooling) can't resolve ESM's extensionless relative imports.
- **Redeploy ≠ deploy latest.** Clicking "Redeploy" on an old deployment row in the dashboard rebuilds *that deployment's pinned commit*, not the branch's latest. Always check the log header's `Commit:` line, or just push and let Git auto-deploy create a fresh deployment. Whichever deployment should be live needs **Promote to Production** explicitly.
- Env vars (`DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, etc.) are set separately per Vercel project — api and admin-web don't share them.

## 11. Vendor management (added 2026-06-30, migration `20260630065402_add_vendors`)
External erection companies ("vendors") are **not** part of Platino — erection is subcontracted.

- **Self-registration** (public, no login): `/vendor/register` → `POST /vendors/register` creates a `pending` vendor. Linked from the login page.
- **Management review/approval**: `/vendors` page (`manage_vendors`) lists all vendors with status + engineer/site counts. Approving (after due diligence) **auto-provisions the vendor's primary contact as an erection-engineer login** — the temp password is shown once. Reject/Reconsider available.
- **Adding more vendor engineers**: Users page → add user with role *Erection Engineer* now requires choosing an **approved vendor** (API enforces it; 400 otherwise).
- **Assigning work**: the site detail "Vendor assignment" control (`manage_vendors`) sets `Site.vendorId` — that's what scopes the site into a vendor's view.
- **Isolation (multi-tenant)**: a vendor's engineers only see/act on sites with their `vendorId`. Enforced on `GET /sites`, `GET /sites/:id`, and every site mutation (another vendor's site → **403**). Vendors never see other vendors (the `/vendors` list requires `manage_vendors`, which vendor users don't have).
- **Data model**: `Vendor` (status, contact, approvedBy/At) + `User.vendorId` + `Site.vendorId`. The seed transfers the sample erection engineer (`erection@platino.example`) and sample site under the approved vendor *Coimbatore Erectors LLP*; *Salem Fabrication Works* is seeded `pending` for the demo.

## 12. Operational notes (gotchas hit during the build)
- **After editing `packages/shared`, rebuild it**: `npm run build --workspace=packages/shared`. Its `main` is `dist/index.js`, so the API/web/seed read the **compiled** output — source edits don't apply until rebuilt (root `postinstall` and `turbo` do this automatically; a direct edit does not). Symptom if you forget: a newly-added constant reads as `undefined` at runtime.
- **Windows Prisma `EPERM` on generate**: if `prisma generate` can't rename `query_engine-windows.dll.node`, a running node process has the DLL loaded. Stop this project's dev servers first; find the exact holder with `Get-Process node | ? { $_.Modules.FileName -like '*Claude code*query_engine*' }`.
- Ports: API pinned to **4001** via `apps/api/.env` (`PORT=4001`); web is `next dev -p 6001`.

## 13. Updated verification (2026-06-30)
Vendor flow verified end-to-end (API + UI): public registration (201) → management approval (creates login + temp password) → vendor isolation (Coimbatore engineer sees only their site; a second vendor sees 0 sites and gets **403** opening the first vendor's site) → erection-engineer-without-vendor rejected (**400**). The `/vendor/register` page renders logged-out; the `/vendors` console renders with status + approve/reject. Both apps `tsc --noEmit` clean.
