/** Daily cleanup of AgentConversation rows older than 30 days (decision: conversation
 * history isn't a permanent audit trail - InvoiceEditLog etc already serve that role - so
 * it's fine to expire and keeps Supabase storage/costs bounded). Invoked by Vercel Cron
 * (see the `crons` entry in vercel.json), which sends `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET`
 * automatically when CRON_SECRET is set as a project env var - this route rejects anything
 * else so it can't be triggered by an arbitrary request.
